Required properties:
	compatible: Must be "ingenic,jz4740-dma"
	reg: The audio controller's regsiters location and length
	clocks: Phandles to the aic and i2s clock
	clock-names: "aic", "i2s"
	dmas: Phandles to the transmit and receive DMA streams
	dma-names: Names for the DMA streams. These strings correspond 1:1 with the
	 ordered pairs in dmas. Valid values are "tx" and "rx"

Example:
	aic: aic@20000 {
		compatible = "ingenic,jz4740-aic";
		reg = <0x20000 0x80>;
		interrupts = <18>;

		clocks = <&aic_clk &i2s_clk>;
		clock-names = "aic", "i2s";

		dmas = <&dmac 0 0 0 &dmac 0 0 0>;
		dma-names = "tx", "rx";
	};
